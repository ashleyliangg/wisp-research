# Readdata.f
## Authors: Ashley Liang, Hans Mueller

## Overview
This fortran file was part of the computational astronomy research project I conducted under Professor Hans Mueller. This file's purpose was to take the data file produced by the existing ZEUS-3D program, take the necessary data from it to perform calculations to factor frequency in (as radial velocity is very important in astronomy) and get a new value dtau (the overall amount of light that passes through at certain frequencies/wavelengths) which will be printed out to a dtau data file and absorb data file. More information about each of the files can be found in readdata.f. 

## Usage
To compile, run `gfortran -c readdata.f wofz.f` and then `gfortran *.o`. To execute the code, run:
```
./a.out filename dtaufile absorbfile
```
For example:
```
./a.out lastframem20v200.dat dtau20v200.dat absorb20v200.dat
```

## My experience
Creating this program was very challenging for me, both because I've never learned Fortran before and because I had a hard time grasping the physics behind it and applying it into the code. My professor started the program and coded the first two loops that reads through the files, stores them into arrays, and derives the first few variables. I developed everything after that. Something that went quite well was that the programming concept came quite easily to me; even though it was a new language, I was easily able to develop the pseudocode behind the code. My professor sent me readings with equations that I needed to use in the program, but it was pretty difficult for me to understand which data points from the data file corresponded to which variable in the equations. Overall, I'm proud that I was able to better understand the concept and purpose behind this code and apply that knowledge to develop the program. I learned a new language very quickly and was able to create something that real researchers will use.

## Results from Data
Below is a video of the animation made from the data in the dtau output file showing the difference between the stellar tau and the interstellar medium's tau within the astrosphere. The animation goes over all 200 frequencies:

Below are some of the images generated by the absorb.tau that we needed to map the simulated taus to the real, observed tau:
